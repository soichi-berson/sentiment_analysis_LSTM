Enhancing Sentiment Analysis Performance with LSTM Models: A Comparative Study

## Introduction
This is a AI project using Python, conducted by Soichiro Tanabe based on the studies from the Open University module: 'AI nad Machine Learning'.

## Data Sources
Kaggle ([available from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews))


## Research Objectives

1. This study aims to assess LSTM model performance in sentiment analysis through comparisons with other models and variations in hyperparameters.
2. It also investigates the influence of different training methodologies, including analysis levels and vocabulary sizes, on LSTM model performance.


The results of analysis are shown in Report (PDF) file.
